      "comment": "Monsstrocity left a review: Let me start by telling you that getting to the top of the mountain and looking down at your achievement is the most thrilling feeling one could ever feel. I have never climbed a mountain, but I have done the Chicago marathon twice, and let me tell you something, pal, that was amazing, the most monumental thing I've ever done. Surrounded by so many people, so many people that were cheering me on the whole time, was the best feeling I have ever had next to my son being born. I have done it once alone and then again with my wife and friend. I've cherished it many times and let my friends know it's my single-handed favorite memory ever. Now let me tell you about Hunter Hunter. I have single-handedly watched this anime 8 eight times. I have read the Manga; the mangaka is finally out of hiatus and is producing new chapters for this fantastic story. There is a reason why my love for Hunter Hunter is as big as it is.\n\nLet's start by getting something off my chest. I'm not the biggest fan of little kids in anime, but this guy, Gon, is a legend amongst the giants of anime. This little kid breaks every barrier with his kind-hearted naive tactics and wins over his foes quickly. He has even done that with me. Now let me start by saying this as well Hisoka's freaky; we know he intends to go ahead and allow Gon to progress through life so that he can have his huge match with him, but he's a little unsettling as a character. I say that just because he's got that whole weird thing going on that just, yeah... Well, let's get back on track so why is this anime so good? Why have I watched this eight times? I'll tell you why every time you think you know what is happening in the anime, it takes an entirely different turn. It has such a fantastic array of characters that blend in together in the same room as everybody else that are just trying to stand out as time progresses. I will go ahead and write more into this review description; know that I don't need to be reminded that this is a masterpiece. Fin"
