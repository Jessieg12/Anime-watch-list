# My Anime Watched and Favorites App
This ever growing list will constist of anime/manga I have watched or read over the years starting when I make this app, give them a rating, and a description/opinion with date stamps of each for later future reference.
If I do end up rewatching/rereading that anime/manga at a later time and my opinions change on it I will be able to add a new opinion on it with a new date stamp.
The reasoning for making this app is to keep track of all the titles I have personally watched/read for tracking purposes.
