# My Anime Watched Application
Hello and welcome to my first project here at Flatiron! My name is Jessie Guzman and this is my Anime Watched Application.
As a teen in junior high school I always really loved watching Toonami and Adult Swim. This was my first exposure to the world of anime, and I will tell you something... it got me hooked instantly.
Now as a 32-year-old man with a lot of stuff going on, I seem to forget a lot of things easily!

This is where this app comes in! I have built this in mind to store any anime I watch starting from the inception of this application.
What I am hoping to accomplish with my app is to be able to store any anime I have watched, how many times I have watched it, and write a review/description of the anime.
I have caught myself so many times not being able to recall a show based on the name but by seeing a title picture or the face of a main protagonist.
 
Unfortunately, this is only half the battle. Though I have been able to recall watching an anime I seem to forget what it was about!
I am hoping by implementing a section to leave a review of the anime that I should be able to recall parts and pieces of it.
Not going to lie but I feel old by saying this, my memory is getting bad at remembering things here and there.
 
Anyone who has sat down to watch The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will tell you it is a badge of honor to watch all of the endless eight. Well... it is not as bad as everyone says.
In the lifespan of Hunter X Hunter being on Crunchyroll, I have watched it a total of eight times now! At the moment I am working towards my ninth watch.
This is why I have a section of my application that also keeps track of my concurrent watched times of each anime. 

You may say, a tad bit of a flex.

Adding a review section, it will allow me to see what the story was about and how I felt about it when I finished it.

Allowing the app to accept new anime titles and an image is also beneficial to keep my current list growing! The image is more so to jog my memories up and keep it looking attractive.
