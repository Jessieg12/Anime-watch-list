# My Anime Watched App
This ever growing list will constist of anime I have watched over the years starting from when I start building this application. 
If I do end up rewatching/rereading that anime/manga at a later time and my opinions change on it I will be able to add a new opinion on it with a new date stamp.
The reasoning for making this app is to keep track of all the titles I have personally watched/read for tracking purposes.

### Installation Instructions
  * Fork and clone github repo into your enviroment here. (git@github.com:Jessieg12/anime-watch-list.git)
  * Install JSON server into your code editor here.(npm install -g json)
  * Open the index.html file in your browser.
  * With Live Server installed go ahead and right click the index.html file and select the "Open With Live Server" option to generate the app's webpage.

### Requirements
  * In order to run our db.json file needed for this app have json-server installed to have access to the needed data.
  * If/once json-server is installed, you will need to run the json-server command in your terminal to have the db.json file running inside the apps directionary. (json-server --watch.db.json).
  * Not a requirement but a strong suggestion, VS users should install the Live Server extension for ease of access to the app's webpage.
